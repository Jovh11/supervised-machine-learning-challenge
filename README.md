This challenge was to demonstrate a basic understanding of the seperating, scaling and application of two basic supervised machine learning models through SKlearn. The first of which was Linear Regression and the second of which was a RandomForestsClassifier. In both cases a training and testing split if required and the data should be scaled according to the training data once split. After which the information should be fit and scored through each respective model. As this is a multivariate problem the likelihood of the RandomForestsClassifier being a better fit than the linear regression was greater which was proven through the application of this notebook.
